# My BaseML Codebook

Here is a link to the BaseMl page:

https://baseml.soilsrc.org

so to make a paragraph just seperate all or your typing with a blank line.


This is a new paraghaph.


This is availble from the [BaseML web page] (https://baseml.soilsrc.org). 

Notice that hashtags make titles. This is a paragraph that has no line returns in it and keeps going until there is a seperate line.

This is another paragraph. Notice it is after a blank line.


Here comes another section with a level two heading.


## Formating

*One star for italics.*

**Two stars for bold.**

***Three stars for bold italics.***

`Backticks to look like code.`

## Lists

Unordered lists use stars.

* Red
* Orange
* Yellow

Ordered lists use `1.`:

1. Item
1. Another item
1. Yet another item

## Separators

These are sometimes called horizontal rules. Just use four dashes `----`.
----

Here is something.

----

 Another thing.

 ----

 Blah.

 ----

 Put a blank line between.

 ## Links

 Just a plain link will be detected:

 Https://skilstak.io

 Or like this will be detected:

 <https://skilstak.io>

 You can also link email adresses:

 <rob@skilstak.com>

 Or you can be fancy and create hyper-linked text:

 Here comes a [link to google](https://google.com)
notice the text is wrapped in square brackets. The link is wrapped in paraentens.

## Images

To embed an image just use the hyper-link syntax but put an exclamation point in front:

![Lake norman sunset](./lakenorman.jpg)

## Fences

Fences let us put other code into our document like JavaScript for example:

```js
console.log('hello)
```

Notice that you use three backticks. These are called *fence posts*.

The first fence post can have a language after it.

You can leave off the language if you want.

``` 
  Roses are red,
  Violets are blue,
  you left your hair line at the zoo.
  ```

  You can also use squiggles:

  ~~~
  STPwake

  ## Blocks
